Game_HookEvents

Associate script file name with callback functions. Note that the format is
 always the same.  Of course, a clever mod team could actually embed parameters, behavior
 into the actual .sc files and create a .sc file parser and hook their functionality through
 that.. i.e., a scripting system.

That was what we were going to do, but we ran out of time...oh well.
